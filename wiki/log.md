## [2026-08-25] create | Wiki initialized
- Vault: https://github.com/Grentchello/oracle_Vault
- Domain: open-ended (Grant's personal KB)
- Hermes Agent wired up with GitHub PAT (Contents: Read+Write) for sync
- Structure created: SCHEMA.md, index.md, log.md, raw/, entities/, concepts/, comparisons/, queries/, _meta/

## [2026-08-25] session-start | Vault bootstrap + auto-log skill
- Moved wiki from /opt/data/home/wiki to /opt/data/hermes_work/wiki (Grant's layout rule)
- Wrote `_meta/method.md` and `_meta/daily-journal.md` documenting the auto-log workflow
- Created `daily/` folder and today's daily note `daily/2026-08-25.md`
- Updated SCHEMA.md, index.md to reference the daily-journal layer
- Created `auto-log` skill — enforces wiki logging + daily note on every session
- Files: _meta/method.md, _meta/daily-journal.md, SCHEMA.md, index.md, daily/2026-08-25.md

## [2026-08-25] create | MkDocs master dashboard
- Restructured git repo: /opt/data/hermes_work/ is now the root, wiki/ is subfolder
- Set up MkDocs Material with phone-friendly theme (dark/light, custom CSS, instant nav)
- Created master dashboard at wiki/index.md with project cards + recent activity
- Created projects/ folder with index.md + _template/ for sub-dashboards
- Created indexes for daily/, entities/, concepts/, comparisons/, queries/
- Wrote GitHub Actions workflow for auto-deploy to GitHub Pages
- Verified MkDocs build locally — all pages return 200, mobile viewport OK
- Pushed restructure (commits be628b9, 3ce4dff)
- Files: mkdocs.yml, wiki/index.md, wiki/projects/, wiki/daily/index.md, wiki/entities/index.md, wiki/concepts/index.md, wiki/comparisons/index.md, wiki/queries/index.md, wiki/assets/extra.css, .github/workflows/docs.yml

## [2026-08-25] pending | Workflow file upload
- .github/workflows/docs.yml ready locally but unable to push (PAT lacks `workflow` scope)
- Waiting for Grant to regenerate PAT with `workflow` scope OR opt for manual paste via GitHub UI
- Once landed: enable Pages (Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions) → site goes live at https://grentchello.github.io/oracle_Vault/

## [2026-08-25] update | PAT upgraded with workflow scope
- Grant updated PAT scopes to include Workflows: Read+write
- Pushed .github/workflows/docs.yml successfully (commit 78f6801)

- Grant created new public repo https://github.com/Grentchello/Oracle_Pages
- Cloned to /opt/data/hermes_work/oracle_pages
- Wrote GitHub Actions workflow that clones oracle_Vault (via ORACLE_VAULT_PAT secret) and builds MkDocs site
- Fixed three build failures: setup-python cache error, id-token permissions at workflow level, pip upgrade
- **Dashboard live at https://grentchello.github.io/Oracle_Pages/** — verified HTTP 200, title "oracle_Vault — Master Dashboard"

## [2026-08-25] create | First project: memecoin-trading
- Ultimate goal: autonomous memecoin trading bot
- Phase 1 foundation: live real prices, paper portfolio, no decisions yet
- Created wiki/projects/memecoin-trading/index.md with strategy candidates, infra decision table, status board
- Added project to mkdocs.yml nav
- Added project card to dashboard home (wiki/index.md) and projects/index.md
- Built bot/bot.py: fetches SOL price from DexScreener, top runners from pump.fun, persists state.json + watchlist.json + decisions.md
- Built wiki/trading/index.html + dashboard.css: phone-first, auto-refreshes every 30s, shows portfolio + holdings + watchlist + decisions
- Set up bot/runner.py (background loop, every 5 min) + Hermes cronjob "memecoin-bot-tick" (every 5 min) — redundant scheduling
- Verified: SOL price fetched live, 5-6 trending pump.fun tokens with DexScreener pairs, portfolio value computed, dashboard live at https://grentchello.github.io/Oracle_Pages/trading/
- Build #5 in Oracle_Pages succeeded
- Files: bot/bot.py, bot/runner.py, wiki/trading/index.html, wiki/trading/assets/dashboard.css, wiki/projects/memecoin-trading/index.md (revised), mkdocs.yml (added Trading nav)
- Vault commits: 823180e (dashboard), bot's auto-commits
- Oracle_Pages commit: 14aaa08 (rebuild trigger)

## [2026-08-25] update | Trading dashboard live
- Verified end-to-end: bot fetches live SOL price ($98.26), pushes to oracle_Vault, Pages rebuilds, dashboard loads
- Bot runner PID 43132 running, will tick every 5 min until container restart
- Hermes cronjob fc079fd07aa6 also scheduled (backup)

## [2026-08-25] update | Phase 2 trading live
- Built bot Phase 2: position manager, entry signals, exit rules, trade ledger
- Strategy: buy top-runners memecoins with $5k+ liq + $10k+ vol24h, 0.1 SOL per position, max 5
- Exits: take-profit +50%, stop-loss -30%, time-stop 24h, momentum-fade (24h flips neg AND ≥+20% profit), slot-pressure
- Dashboard updated: trade history section + win rate KPI + per-trade P&L breakdown
- Fixed earlier 404 (decisions.md → bundled into state.json as recent_decisions)
- Bot opened first positions: $unc, $BURNIE, $neet, $TripleT (4/5 slots used, 0.4 SOL deployed of 2.0)
- 0 closed trades yet — give it time
- Files: bot/bot.py (rewritten, 24KB), wiki/trading/index.html (rewritten, 13KB), wiki/trading/assets/dashboard.css (added trade styles)
- Paused cronjob (runner is sufficient)

## [2026-08-25] update | Strategy v2 — riskier, faster, learning
- Grant directive: aim for +20% in 24h, learn from every trade, take risks
- Tightened exits: TP -50%→+30% partial (sell half) + full TP at +60%, SL -30%→-20%, max-hold 24h→12h
- Added composite entry score: 24h change + recency bonus + turnover bonus + short-momentum boost (need ≥5.0 to enter)
- Added post-mortem analysis: every closed trade compares entry vs exit signals and diagnoses what changed
- Added Strategy Learning section: surfaces win/loss signal patterns once ≥3 wins AND ≥3 losses
- Added daily target tracking: +20% on 2 SOL paper = +0.4 SOL/day, dashboard has progress bar
- 4 open positions from earlier run will exit via new SL/time-stop rules; learning starts fresh
- Files: bot/bot.py (rewritten, 32KB), wiki/trading/index.html (daily bar, learning section, post-mortem in trade items), wiki/trading/assets/dashboard.css (new styles)
- Already-deployed HTML has 9 references to new features, daily_target_pct=20 in state.json
